<br/>
<br/>
This website is a simple yet unique example of a responsive website. It consists of four pages, each with a responsive header and footer for easy navigation and displaying important details.
<br/>
<br/>

# Frontend:

<br/>
The landing page is designed to attract users to the website, with an eye-catching main lead space featuring the website logo, a welcoming message, and inspiring quotes.
<br/>
<br/>

The About Us page provides information about the purpose of the website, giving users a better understanding of its goals and objectives.
<br/>
<br/>

On the Contact Us page, visitors can find an example of how to reach out to us, along with a form to submit queries or messages. I have also included an alert box to display messages that visitors may receive after submitting the form.
<br/>
<br/>

Finally, the Admin page features a login form for the website administrator, who can access the messages and queries received from visitors through the contact form. This provides a secure and efficient way to manage and respond to user feedback.

For Admin Login, use email - admin@webique.com , and password - admin

# Backend:

<br/>
<br/>
I have also implemented a REST API for HTTP requests, and by using Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB for backend functionality like creating new message, getting all messages stored in database, deleting a message, admin authentication.
